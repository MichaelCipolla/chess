-> Problem: When we select a piece, we need to constrain its behavior based on the type of piece it is.

    -> State?
        -> Upon picking up a piece, we could transition to different states:
            -> PieceControllerStateMachine
                -> Active
                    -> Bishop
                    -> Queen
                    -> King
                    -> Rook
                    -> Knight
                    -> Pawn
                        -> Inactive

                IPieceState:
                    -> BishopState
                    -> QueenState
                    -> KingState
                    -> RookState
                    -> KnightState
                    -> PawnState

                -> IPieceState()
                    -> validateMove(int index)
                        // Here we can query whether or not there is a piece on the requested index.
                        // We will also need to iterate through all possible moves to determine if there is a piece blocking the path for sliding pieces.
                        
                        -> capturePiece();
                            // Here we will update the ChessData matrix with replacement to create capture
                            // This will also adjust the score? Maybe this justifies having both
                        -> placePiece();
                            // Here we will simply replace blank spaces with our selected piece.
                            
                How do we handle individual piece movements if we aren't using class instantiations for the piece itself?
                    -> We have a state that can support general piece movements, but for a pawn specifically we need to know if this is the first time the pawn is moving.
                        -> If this is the pawn's first move of the game, we can allow it to move 2 spaces.
                        -> If an enemy pawn is attacking one of the 2 spaces, it can capture the friendly pawn "in passing", moving to the space it was attacking.
                    -> We need to know the castle status of the kings as well.
                        -> castling requires:
                            -> the spaces between the king and the respective rook to be empty.
                            -> the spaces between the king and the respective rook cannot be under attack (inclusive of king and rook spaces)
                            -> the king cannot have moved yet.
                            -> the target friendly rook cannot have moved yet.

                            -> We could use a "special move byte"
                                -> If piece is a:
                                    -> Pawn
                                    -> King
                                   We can add an extra byte to our datagram to indicate whether or not the unit has used up its special move
                                    -> This byte could simply track if a piece has moved before:
                                        -> This would be useful since we need to know if the King OR Rook have moved for the sake of castling
                                        -> Both castling and fast pawn moves require that the piece has not moved yet.
                                            -> Current datagram:

1. Ok we need to do some major refactoring. I want to have a class for each piece type, I want our controls to be an interface 
    -> I'm opting for an interface for the controls over an abstract class for the sake of possibly combining multiple controls for a piece (this would allow us to make more than just chess as a game)
        I think this is a good solution for this
    -> As for the class, I have a number of problems with this code. I want to accomplish a type of Model, View, Control design, where I abstract all of the information that is important for the game
    into a type of Model, which interfaces with the View. This way we could potentially have different types of client side representations of the chess game.

    -> Should we have a main class or an abstract gamepiece class that requires its members to have certain methods? What are the benefits / drawbacks of both?
        1. Presume we have one class for all of our chess pieces.... Would we write a new implementation for each? Not sure if C# even supports that kind of coding...
            -> Ultimately we need to have a different validation method for each piece, which would differentiate valid moves from invalid moves. Each piece should also probably have its own way of determining 
            if it is capturing a piece? Not 100% sure yet.

        2. Ok we have a system where we create a gamePiece, but not a specific chess piece. We still need to be able to differentiate
        between the different pieces who will have their implementations defined in their respective classes???
            -> So... next step will involve creating new classes for each piece, which we will index through a function that returns a class instantiation?
                -> i.e. GamePiece piece = someFunct(...);
